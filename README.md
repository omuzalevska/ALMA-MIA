# ALMA-MIA

Here is the process of creating our project "Alma Mia"

On the first day, the presentation topic was chosen, a Github repository and main were created

We chose traditional cuisine from different countries of the world as our theme! We discussed the design of the main page of the site, the colors that will be used in the project, selected the most interesting and attractive dishes, the countries were chosen according to our common opinion. The logo was created manually using AI technology

The main colors for the style are green, gold, white and black.
The countries are: Venezuela, Spain, Ethiopia, Ukraine and Russia.
Look at the dishes on the page, you won't regret it :)
